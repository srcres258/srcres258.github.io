The transformation is available through IGeometryBakingContext#getRootTransform() in IUnbakedGeometry#bake().","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"rendering/modelextensions/visibility":{"id":"rendering/modelextensions/visibility","title":"Part Visibility","description":"Adding the visibility entry at the top level of a model JSON allows control over the visibility of different parts of the model to decide whether they should be baked into the final BakedModel. The definition of a \\"part\\" is dependent on the model loader loading this model and custom model loaders are free to ignore this entry completely. Out of the model loaders provided by Forge only the composite model loader and the OBJ model loader make use of this functionality. The visibility entries are specified as \\"part name\\": boolean entries.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"rendering/modelloaders/bakedmodel":{"id":"rendering/modelloaders/bakedmodel","title":"BakedModel","description":"BakedModel is the result of calling UnbakedModel#bake for the vanilla model loader or IUnbakedGeometry#bake for custom model loaders. Unlike UnbakedModel or IUnbakedGeometry, which purely represents a shape without any concept of items or blocks, BakedModel is not as abstract. It represents geometry that has been optimized and reduced to a form where it is (almost) ready to go to the GPU. It can also process the state of an item or block to change the model.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"rendering/modelloaders/index":{"id":"rendering/modelloaders/index","title":"Custom Model Loaders","description":"A \\"model\\" is simply a shape. It can be a simple cube, it can be several cubes, it can be a truncated icosidodecahedron, or anything in between. Most models you\'ll see will be in the vanilla JSON format. Models in other formats are loaded into IUnbakedGeometrys by an IGeometryLoader at runtime. Forge provides default implementations for WaveFront OBJ files, buckets, composite models, models in different render layers, and a reimplementation of Vanilla\'s builtin/generated item model. Most things do not care about what loaded the model or what format it\'s in as they are all eventually represented by an BakedModel in code.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"rendering/modelloaders/itemoverrides":{"id":"rendering/modelloaders/itemoverrides","title":"ItemOverrides","description":"ItemOverrides provides a way for an BakedModel to process the state of an ItemStack and return a new BakedModel; thereafter, the returned model replaces the old one. ItemOverrides represents an arbitrary function (BakedModel, ItemStack, ClientLevel, LivingEntity, int) \u2192 BakedModel, making it useful for dynamic models. In vanilla, it is used to implement item property overrides.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"rendering/modelloaders/transform":{"id":"rendering/modelloaders/transform","title":"Transform","description":"When an BakedModel is being rendered as an item, it can apply special handling depending on which transform it is being rendered in. \\"Transform\\" means in what context the model is being rendered. The possible transforms are represented in code by the ItemDisplayContext enum. There are two systems for handling transform: the deprecated vanilla system, constituted by BakedModel#getTransforms, ItemTransforms, and ItemTransform, and the Forge system, embodied by the method IForgeBakedModel#applyTransform. The vanilla code is patched to favor using applyTransform over the vanilla system whenever possible.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/client/index":{"id":"resources/client/index","title":"Resource Packs","description":"Resource Packs allow for the customization of client resources through the assets directory. This includes textures, models, sounds, localizations, and others. Your mod (as well as Forge itself) can also have resource packs. Any user can therefore modify all the textures, models, and other assets defined within this directory.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/client/models/index":{"id":"resources/client/models/index","title":"Models","description":"The model system is Minecraft\'s way of giving blocks and items their shapes. Through the model system, blocks and items are mapped to their models, which define how they look. One of the main goals of the model system is to allow not only textures but the entire shape of a block/item to be changed by resource packs. Indeed, any mod that adds items or blocks also contains a mini-resource pack for their blocks and items.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/client/models/itemproperties":{"id":"resources/client/models/itemproperties","title":"Item Properties","description":"Item properties are a way for the \\"properties\\" of items to be exposed to the model system. An example is the bow, where the most important property is how far the bow has been pulled. This information is then used to choose a model for the bow, creating an animation for pulling it.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/client/models/tinting":{"id":"resources/client/models/tinting","title":"Coloring Textures","description":"Many blocks and items in vanilla change their texture color depending on where they are or what properties they have, such as grass.

See the wiki for information on how tint indices are defined in vanilla models.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/advancements":{"id":"resources/server/advancements","title":"Advancements","description":"Advancements are tasks that can be achieved by the player which may advance the progress of the game. Advancements can trigger based on any action the player may be directly involved in.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/conditional":{"id":"resources/server/conditional","title":"Conditionally-Loaded Data","description":"There are times when modders may want to include data-driven objects using information from another mod without having to explicitly make that mod a dependency. Other cases may be to swap out certain objects with other modded entries when they are present. This can be done through the conditional subsystem.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/glm":{"id":"resources/server/glm","title":"Global Loot Modifiers","description":"Global Loot Modifiers are a data-driven method of handling modification of harvested drops without the need to overwrite dozens to hundreds of vanilla loot tables or to handle effects that would require interactions with another mod\'s loot tables without knowing what mods may be loaded. Global Loot Modifiers are also stacking, rather than last-load-wins, similar to tags.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/index":{"id":"resources/server/index","title":"Datapacks","description":"In 1.13, Mojang added datapacks to the base game. They allow for the modification of the files for logical servers through the data directory. This includes advancements, loot_tables, structures, recipes, tags, etc. Forge, and your mod, can also have datapacks. Any user can therefore modify all the recipes, loot tables, and other data defined within this directory.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/loottables":{"id":"resources/server/loottables","title":"Loot Tables","description":"Loot tables are logic files which dictate what should happen when various actions or scenarios occur. Although the vanilla system deals purely with item generation, the system can be expanded to perform any number of defined actions.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/recipes/custom":{"id":"resources/server/recipes/custom","title":"Custom Recipes","description":"Every recipe definition is made up of three components: the Recipe implementation which holds the data and handles the execution logic with the provided inputs, the RecipeType which represents the category or context the recipe will be used in, and the RecipeSerializer which handles decoding and network communication of the recipe data. How one chooses to use the recipe is up to the implementor.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"resources/server/recipes/incode":{"id":"resources/server/recipes/incode","title":"Non-Datapack Recipes","description":"Not all recipes are simplistic enough or migrated to using data-driven recipes.
